03:24.620 --> 03:27.450
Do you think I'd trust a coward like you?

03:27.580 --> 03:30.870
You're not trustworthy, either!

it'd turn out this way?!

Straw Hat's doing so well!

04:05.620 --> 04:09.410
We must make use of it.
Don't you think so?

04:09.450 --> 04:10.790
You see?!

04:10.830 --> 04:15.380
That formidable Kaido
has never been weakened like this!

04:15.420 --> 04:21.630
This is our first and last big chance
to take him down!

04:22.670 --> 04:29.010
Right after Kaido takes down Straw Hat,
I'll send these guys to fight him!

04:29.060 --> 04:30.770
And then what?!

04:30.810 --> 04:34.730
It won't last two seconds!

04:40.780 --> 04:44.280

Understood.

05:08.090 --> 05:12.520
I knew you'd understand, Drake!

Now we'll be the real winners in this war!

05:18.440 --> 05:20.650

This is...

Wait, wait! Are you nuts?!

05:33.950 --> 05:35.870

If he had just nodded,
he wouldn't have had to die.

06:05.740 --> 06:08.200
I already figured out
how your attack works!

06:11.070 --> 06:13.080
It won't work on me.

06:13.200 --> 06:14.700
Stop bluffing!

06:14.830 --> 06:16.620
Your line of attack...

06:17.160 --> 06:18.580
...is hard to see,

06:19.040 --> 06:20.210
but it's surely there!

06:20.830 --> 06:22.790
Activation requires the target's hearing.

06:22.840 --> 06:24.710
And the scope is your eyes!

06:24.840 --> 06:27.380
Don't give it all away!

06:27.420 --> 06:29.970
That doesn't make any difference!

06:30.010 --> 06:35.430
You're cornered
because I have three Numbers here!

06:36.600 --> 06:37.810
Doesn't matter!

06:38.350 --> 06:42.650
To do my duty by Straw Hat,
I need to take you down!

06:42.770 --> 06:44.860
That's bullshit!

06:44.900 --> 06:47.820
I hope you won't regret...

06:47.860 --> 06:50.530
...that you blew your chance...

07:03.460 --> 07:04.130
Huh?

07:04.630 --> 07:09.510
Drake! Apoo! What are a Tobi Roppo member
and an informant doing here?!

07:09.630 --> 07:14.720
That's what I wanna ask you!
Young Master, why are you here?

07:21.940 --> 07:24.860
I thought you were
fighting against Kaido...

07:24.980 --> 07:26.690
I gotta go to the armory...

07:26.820 --> 07:28.490
<i>Yamato...</i>

07:28.530 --> 07:31.610
<i>Yamato?! He is Kaido's enemy!</i>

07:32.320 --> 07:35.490
<i>That fool Drake is useless, so...</i>

07:37.160 --> 07:39.000
<i>Let's switch!</i>

07:39.330 --> 07:41.080
Okay, I gotta go!

07:43.630 --> 07:44.540
Drake, let me...

07:44.670 --> 07:48.170
Wait, wait! Young Master Yamato!

07:48.710 --> 07:51.550
I got some good news for you!

07:52.510 --> 07:55.550
I don't know what it is,
but I don't have time!

07:56.180 --> 07:58.890
I completely cut ties with Kaido!

07:58.930 --> 08:00.770
Don't think of me as your ally!

08:00.890 --> 08:03.690
Really?!
Then I'd like to talk to you even more!

08:03.810 --> 08:07.820
Anyway, I don't have time
to chat with you guys anymore!

08:07.860 --> 08:10.570
Let me go, Animal Kingdom Pirates!

08:10.900 --> 08:12.030
Don't get in my way!

08:12.150 --> 08:13.860
Wait, Yamato. I...

08:14.320 --> 08:17.240
If you don't move...
I'll force my way through!

08:18.160 --> 08:19.080
Hey, wait!

08:19.200 --> 08:21.870
Don't think you can stop me!

08:26.460 --> 08:28.340
Get out of my way already!

08:28.460 --> 08:30.920
I broke away
from the Animal Kingdom Pirates!

08:30.960 --> 08:33.550
I have nothing to do
with Kaido now, either!

08:33.680 --> 08:35.140
What?! Really?!

08:35.640 --> 08:38.010
I'm sorry, Drake! I gotta go!

08:49.770 --> 08:51.780
All right! I gotta get going!

08:52.400 --> 08:55.160
Onigashima and the Flower Capital
are in danger!

08:55.280 --> 08:55.860
Hey!

08:57.620 --> 09:00.580
Damn! Why's everyone so useless?!

09:00.620 --> 09:02.870
They're all so boring!

09:03.460 --> 09:08.710
I really don't wanna die like a dog
after being pushed around!

09:09.460 --> 09:12.170
I have to get Yamato on my side somehow!

09:14.260 --> 09:15.840
What's wrong, Fuga?

09:19.050 --> 09:20.600
Where are you going, Fuga?!

09:23.680 --> 09:24.390
What?!

09:25.100 --> 09:25.980
What is it?!

09:31.440 --> 09:32.030
What?!

09:41.830 --> 09:43.160
Fuga!

09:44.040 --> 09:45.080
See you!

09:47.540 --> 09:49.000
Hey, Fuga...

09:53.920 --> 09:55.470
What?!

09:56.090 --> 09:57.720
Where are you going, Fuga?!

09:57.760 --> 09:59.840
Stop!

09:59.890 --> 10:02.560
What the hell is going on?!

10:02.600 --> 10:03.220
Hey!

10:04.140 --> 10:08.020
Let's stop them! Follow me, guys!

10:12.900 --> 10:14.650
I won't let him get away!

10:14.690 --> 10:18.030
Young Master Yamato!

10:19.990 --> 10:22.160
I won't let you get away, Apoo!

10:33.840 --> 10:36.550
They are... extremely strong!

10:37.260 --> 10:40.550
Before more people fall victim,

10:40.590 --> 10:42.890
give Nico Robin to us.

10:46.390 --> 10:48.310
No way!

10:48.430 --> 10:49.020
Wait!

10:49.560 --> 10:51.900
Run, Baron Corpse!

10:52.020 --> 10:53.190
Why?!

10:53.610 --> 10:55.610
Protect Nico Robin!

10:56.070 --> 10:58.440
We need you to leave them to us.

11:05.290 --> 11:06.660
Minks!

11:06.790 --> 11:08.790
Go, Baron Corpse!

11:10.120 --> 11:11.210
Robin-<i>san</i>!

11:12.540 --> 11:14.000
Let's go!

11:14.540 --> 11:15.550
Brook!

11:18.340 --> 11:22.800
We can't let their sacrifice go to waste!

11:41.610 --> 11:44.620
They're beating the Minks
so one-sidedly...

11:44.950 --> 11:47.240
I wonder who they are.

11:47.660 --> 11:52.920
They're a Cipher Pol unit, CP-0,
who were at Dressrosa...

11:53.040 --> 11:57.840
Cipher Pol?! It's an intelligence organization
working directly under the Government, right?!

11:58.340 --> 12:01.260
Why are they here on Onigashima?!

12:01.380 --> 12:02.340
I don't know...

12:02.930 --> 12:06.720
One thing I know is
the situation can't get any worse.

12:06.850 --> 12:07.350
What?!

12:08.350 --> 12:11.980
Among CP-0,
the top-ranked unit in Cipher Pol,

12:12.940 --> 12:16.520
the masked agents
are even more exceptional.

12:17.480 --> 12:18.940
I see...

12:19.440 --> 12:23.450
If we have to run,
we'll be running for our life...

12:23.490 --> 12:27.240
I'm already dead though!

12:27.910 --> 12:29.040
She's so cold!

12:38.800 --> 12:41.760
It's bonebreaking work to shake them off.

12:43.050 --> 12:44.340
That's a good one!

12:44.630 --> 12:46.930
Robin-<i>san</i>, leave it to me!

12:47.640 --> 12:48.970
Let's jump!

12:59.110 --> 13:00.270
That time, too...

13:05.780 --> 13:07.200
And that time...

13:11.660 --> 13:12.660
I...

13:16.040 --> 13:20.250
...am gonna become
just like those assholes of Germa...

13:21.300 --> 13:22.760
You've got to be kidding!

13:26.510 --> 13:27.590
What should I do?

13:27.970 --> 13:29.350
Chuji!

13:30.850 --> 13:34.020
Where did you go, Chuji?

13:41.020 --> 13:43.230
I-I'm sorry I...

13:43.650 --> 13:45.740
Please! Help me!

13:46.320 --> 13:48.360
<i>Judge said...</i>

13:48.950 --> 13:52.240

I'm begging you! Please let me go!

14:05.170 --> 14:09.390
Germa's blood in your veins
is actually making you excited, right?!

14:09.840 --> 14:11.640
Shut up! I...

14:12.850 --> 14:14.600
...am human!

14:17.270 --> 14:17.810
What?

14:29.070 --> 14:30.110
You okay, lady?

14:30.240 --> 14:31.320
Stay away from me!

14:31.950 --> 14:32.740
What?

14:33.160 --> 14:34.370
Stay away...

14:59.560 --> 15:00.650
Help!

15:03.230 --> 15:05.400
Osome, what happened?!

15:05.730 --> 15:08.110
You're bleeding! Who did this?!

15:09.820 --> 15:11.820
Are you okay? Let me help you!

15:14.240 --> 15:17.700
How could you do this
to a young girl like her!

15:18.620 --> 15:20.960
Wait! There's been a misunderstanding!

15:21.080 --> 15:21.870
Shut up!

15:21.920 --> 15:24.250
You're from the army of
the Land of Wano, right?!

15:24.380 --> 15:25.500
Yeah...

15:26.090 --> 15:28.260
How dare you do this to your own?!

15:28.380 --> 15:31.260
No! Listen to me!

15:31.720 --> 15:33.140
I'm sure I...

15:35.180 --> 15:38.140
I didn't do anything...

15:40.600 --> 15:41.890
Didn't do anything...

15:42.770 --> 15:43.600
...to her...

15:44.690 --> 15:45.900
I think...

15:47.530 --> 15:49.650
Stop lying!

15:49.940 --> 15:52.240
Osome ran from you!

15:52.360 --> 15:55.950
Get out of here! We're hiding in here!

15:56.200 --> 15:59.330
I can't believe you'd assault
an innocent woman!

16:00.080 --> 16:02.670
That can't be true! I...

16:02.790 --> 16:04.960
You brute!

16:07.380 --> 16:09.170
To hell with cowards!

16:09.300 --> 16:11.220
Just go away already!

16:15.430 --> 16:16.350
I...

16:17.010 --> 16:17.970
I...

16:23.520 --> 16:25.190
That's impossible...

16:26.110 --> 16:28.570
I would never assault a lady...

16:33.820 --> 16:34.860
Hey!

16:35.870 --> 16:38.370
Germa!

16:41.160 --> 16:45.540
Where've you been?
I thought the Pleasure Hall was closed!

16:45.670 --> 16:48.750
No! That's the last thing I would do!

16:49.500 --> 16:51.960
How could I lay a hand on...

16:54.720 --> 16:57.760
They knocked a woman unconscious...

16:58.600 --> 17:01.680
You gave a woman of low birth
a taste of self-confidence.

17:01.810 --> 17:03.890
You only bring shame to the Vinsmokes.

17:04.020 --> 17:06.980
Royalty has its own reckoning of the world!

17:07.100 --> 17:12.150
An idiot who has no respect for food.
A man who beats a woman.

17:12.190 --> 17:16.320
The arrogance of royalty that compels you
to see your servants as less than human!

17:16.360 --> 17:20.450
Everything about you guys goes against
what I stand for!

17:21.450 --> 17:24.000
<i>Am I gonna be like them?!</i>

17:26.000 --> 17:30.250
<i>My body isn't tingling anymore...
Is the mutation over?</i>

17:31.130 --> 17:34.590
<i>I was caught up in my thoughts
at that time...</i>

17:35.680 --> 17:37.930
<i>But the moment I noticed her...</i>

17:38.640 --> 17:41.760
<i>...she was flying and bleeding...</i>

17:42.470 --> 17:44.980
<i>...and looking at me, scared!</i>

17:45.600 --> 17:47.730
What's the matter?!

17:47.770 --> 17:51.940
Show me Germa's true power!

17:52.440 --> 17:56.900
Without the suit, you're no match for me!

17:58.860 --> 17:59.740
<i>I...</i>

18:03.160 --> 18:04.370
<i>Hey, Luffy...</i>

18:05.870 --> 18:07.580
<i>Which one do you prefer?</i>

18:09.130 --> 18:13.500
<i>This human me who isn't reliable
because I'd be helpless...</i>

18:13.920 --> 18:16.170
<i>...when our enemy is a woman...</i>

18:17.510 --> 18:22.720
<i>...or the cruel and heartless warrior of science
who can beat up a monster like this...</i>

18:23.560 --> 18:27.850
<i>...and will bring anybody's head
when he's ordered!</i>

18:28.980 --> 18:31.770
<i>Which version of me
can help the King of the Pirates?</i>

18:34.940 --> 18:37.190
Hey you, cook! Join my group!

18:37.240 --> 18:39.740
Be the cook on my pirate ship!

18:39.780 --> 18:43.030
You're a good cook,
so let's be pirates together!

18:44.240 --> 18:48.710
Be sure to come back, Sanji!

18:49.170 --> 18:52.880
Without you, I...

18:56.090 --> 18:59.010
I don't know what'll happen...

19:00.510 --> 19:02.970
Is that Germa's suit?!

19:04.720 --> 19:06.350
I made up my mind.

19:06.720 --> 19:11.770
I'm tired of waiting!
Let me enjoy it to the fullest!

19:12.520 --> 19:14.610
Probably because I wore this,

19:15.270 --> 19:18.990
the "science" that was in my body
from birth awakened.

19:20.200 --> 19:21.860
Nothing can be done about it.

19:21.990 --> 19:26.620
That's right! Accept it!
Show me Germa's science!

19:26.740 --> 19:27.910
If so...

19:29.210 --> 19:31.120
then no more!

19:40.380 --> 19:43.890
<i>Without you, I...</i>

19:44.390 --> 19:48.350
<i>I can't become the King of the Pirates!!</i>

19:53.190 --> 19:54.150
I...

19:55.190 --> 19:56.820
...won't become a Germa warrior!

19:58.070 --> 19:59.820
What a waste!

19:59.860 --> 20:02.070
Show me your transformation!

20:05.870 --> 20:07.660
<i>Goodbye, Germa!</i>

20:09.580 --> 20:10.700
<i>Goodbye...</i>

20:11.460 --> 20:12.420
<i>Women's bath!</i>

20:13.120 --> 20:14.960
<i>I'm gonna finish...</i>

20:15.750 --> 20:17.090
<i>...this fight!</i>

20:25.340 --> 20:29.560
Ring, ring, ring... Ring, ring, ring...

20:30.140 --> 20:31.810
Ring, ring, ring...

20:32.810 --> 20:33.600
Clank.

20:34.150 --> 20:36.860
Did I have a Transponder Snail?

20:40.190 --> 20:42.490
Who's calling me at a time like this?!

20:42.820 --> 20:44.490
Not now!

20:46.370 --> 20:48.660
I snuck one into your belly band.

20:49.660 --> 20:52.410
Just in case
you die in a gutter somewhere.

20:52.540 --> 20:54.000
<i>Stupid Cook!</i>

20:56.330 --> 20:58.090
Don't bother me!

20:58.210 --> 21:00.130
<i>It won't take long so listen.</i>

21:05.260 --> 21:09.720
We're gonna beat
the Animal Kingdom Pirates.

21:15.310 --> 21:17.230
Yeah, of course!

21:18.060 --> 21:19.690
But after the battle,

21:21.030 --> 21:23.990
if I lose my mind,

21:30.080 --> 21:32.160
<i>you must kill me.</i>

21:49.260 --> 21:50.100
<i>Hey.</i>

21:53.770 --> 21:55.430
<i>Okay, I got it.</i>

21:56.270 --> 21:59.560
<i>I'll make sure to kill you myself!</i>

22:01.360 --> 22:03.230
<i>I don't know what the deal is,</i>

22:03.730 --> 22:06.150
<i>but I got something to look forward to!</i>

22:08.570 --> 22:10.200
In that case,

22:11.910 --> 22:13.870
don't die until then!

22:15.370 --> 22:16.620
Thanks.

22:16.750 --> 22:18.000
Clank.

22:33.220 --> 22:36.560
Where did you go?!
Is that a science thing, too?!

22:36.600 --> 22:38.810
Judge's son!

22:41.400 --> 22:43.730
Hey, don't add fuel to the fire!

22:49.200 --> 22:51.570
It's already burning!

22:55.950 --> 22:57.910
I'll show you hell!

23:02.880 --> 23:05.670
Hell Memories!

23:18.600 --> 23:21.850
<i>The flames spreading through the castle
engulf both armies</i>

23:21.900 --> 23:24.610
<i>and plunge them
into pandemonium full of agonizing cries!</i>

23:24.650 --> 23:27.860
<i>Will the long-held resentment of the Kurozumi Clan,</i>

23:27.900 --> 23:31.860
<i>which consumes everything in its path,
engulf Onigashima as well?</i>

23:31.910 --> 23:35.580
<i>The Kurozumi Clan Suicide reaches its climax!</i>

23:36.490 --> 23:37.750
On the next episode of One Piece!

23:37.790 --> 23:41.670
"The Onslaught of Kazenbo -
Orochi's Evil Clutches Close in"

23:41.710 --> 23:45.590
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!
